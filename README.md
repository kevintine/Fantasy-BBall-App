Writing out a plan to code this Fantasy Basketball App.
I want it to take yahoo fantasy teams and analyze stats of my choosing and we can compare it to other teams. 
We are able to see point, steals, blocks etc totals in comparison.
Eventually it will be able to suggest players to go for to improve team stats.

1: Make player and team classes to store data in.__ 
2: For now, pull data from txt files to fill out players and teams.
3: Take player names and search them up on basketball reference for specific stats. 
4: Add player totals and display overall team stats.
