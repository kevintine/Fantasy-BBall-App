# Fantasy-BBall-App

2024-09-23

Writing out a plan to code this Fantasy Basketball App.

I want it to take yahoo fantasy teams and analyze stats of my choosing and we can compare it to other teams. 

We are able to see point, steals, blocks etc totals in comparison.
Eventually it will be able to suggest players to go for to improve team stats.

Allow for selection of averages of 5, 10, 15, 20 and all days within the NBA season

Currently done:
- Connection to yahoo Oauth2 
- Creation of Team and Player classes for better organization and reuseablity
- Pull all teams according to league
- Display all Players according to team
- Adding averages for all players 
- Team comparison between two teams

Planning to do:
- Update existing classes and functions
- Create a basic index.html tmeplate for data display
